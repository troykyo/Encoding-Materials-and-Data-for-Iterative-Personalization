\begin{abstract}
Data is changing how we design consumer products. Shoe production is a prime example of this; foot size, footstep pressure and personal preferences can be used to design personalized shoes. Research done around metamaterials, programming materials and computational composites illustrate the possibilities of creating complex data \& material relationships. These new relationships allow us to look at future products almost like software apps, becoming a kind of product service systems, where the focus is on its iterative personalized improvement over time. Can we create systems of such data driven objects that in turn allow us to design new objects that are informed by the data trail? In this paper we report on four RtD project iterations that explore this challenge and provide a set of insights on how to close this new iterative loop.

\caption{Overview of four shoe design projects that together created a loop of iterative personalization. These shoes were digitally fabricated with parametric data and worn as everyday shoes. From left to right we see an example of each project. The shoes started as a generic sizes and progressed to personalized shoes that created data for subsequent shoes while in use.}
